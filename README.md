# Simulation-of-Line-Scan-Camera

Developed a custom Python program to simulate the effects of a line-scan camera prior to its availability. The program treated an attached camera as a line-scan camera, capturing images upon hitting the space bar and concatenating the resulting line-scan images for further analysis.

My line-scan camera can go up to 30000Hz/sec
